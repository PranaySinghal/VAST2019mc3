        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <div>The City has been using Y*INT to communicate with its citizens, even post-earthquake. However, City
            officials needs additional information to determine the best way to allocate emergency resources across
            all neighborhoods of St. Himark. Your task, using your visual analytics on the community Y*INT data, is
            to determine the types of problems that are occurring across the St. Himark. Then, advise the City on how
            to prioritize the distribution of resources.  Keep in mind that not all sources on Y*INT are reliable,
            and that priorities may change over time as the state of neighborhoods also changes.<br><br></div>

        <div class="question">1- Using  visual analytics, characterize conditions across the city and recommend how
            resources
            should be
            allocated at 5 hours and 30 hours after the earthquake.  Include evidence from the data to support these
            recommendations.  Consider how to allocate resources such as road crews, sewer repair crews, power, and rescue teams. Limit your response to 1000 words and 12 images.</div>


        <div class="question">2 - Identify at least 3 times when conditions change in a way that warrants a re-allocation of
            city
            resources.  What were the conditions before and after the inflection point?  What locations were affected?  Which resources are involved? Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.</div>


        <div class="question">3 - Take the pulse of the community.  How has the earthquake affected life in St. Himark?
            What is the community experiencing outside the realm of the first two questions? Show decision makers summary information and relevant/characteristic examples. Limit your response to 800 words and 8 images.</div>

        <div class="question">4 - The data for this challenge can be analyzed either as a
            static collection or as a dynamic stream of data, as it would occur in a real emergency.  Describe how you analyzed the data - as a static collection or a stream.  How do you think this choice affected your analysis? Limit your response to 200 words and 3 images.</div>
