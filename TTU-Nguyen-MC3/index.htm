        <h4>System Overview</h4>
        The analytics application includes active, interactive components that are able to work with dynamic, streaming
        data.
        The main control board (A) is built as a stream graph. Each stream represents the number of posts classified as
        the selected categories from selection panel (A1).
        Each of these categories come with a set of keywords to decide if a message belongs to a category or not.

        A sliding window across the stream graph is provided for specific selection of time frame at a particular
        timestamp.
        This time frame can be expanded from 1 hour to 31 hours by user. The vertical axis shows the number of posts,
        while the horizontal axis shows the timeline.<br><br>

        The other four components are depicted as panels B to E in <a href="#overviewFig">Figure 1</a>. For each change
        in main
        panel
        A –
        whether it is choosing another time frame,
        timestamp or category selection, all other 4 panels are updated according to A.

        <br><br>
        To demonstrate the evolution of a topic, panel B provides a WordStream, showcasing the content of corresponding
        messages for the chosen time frame and the chosen categories.
        The WordStream consists of two topics: the keywords within content of messages and location of the message.
        Thickness of the stream is proportional to number of posts – the global trend.
        Users can also explore the local trend of an individual term and detail of messages.
        <br><br>
        Panel C is a map of St. Himark, in which the color of each neighborhood indicates the number of posts for the
        chosen time frame and the chosen categories.
        User can use this map for highlighting corresponding terms in the WordStream and vice versa.
        <br><br>
        Panel D is a network of user interaction for the chosen time frame and the chosen categories.
        The network demonstrates the connection between users, through the account mentioning in content of messages.
        Via this network, we can spot which one is the account that has important role in the community.
        <br><br>
        Panel E is an account list for ranking content creators. This chart shows the accounts the write the largest
        number of posts for the chosen time frame and the chosen categories. From this chart, users can see who write
        many posts but not connected to the community, exploring these points can help to detect irrelevant accounts.

        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <div>The City has been using Y*INT to communicate with its citizens, even post-earthquake. However, City
            officials needs additional information to determine the best way to allocate emergency resources across
            all neighborhoods of St. Himark. Your task, using your visual analytics on the community Y*INT data, is
            to determine the types of problems that are occurring across the St. Himark. Then, advise the City on how
            to prioritize the distribution of resources. Keep in mind that not all sources on Y*INT are reliable,
            and that priorities may change over time as the state of neighborhoods also changes.<br><br></div>

        <div class="question">1- Using visual analytics, characterize conditions across the city and recommend how
            resources
            should be
            allocated at 5 hours and 30 hours after the earthquake. Include evidence from the data to support these
            recommendations. Consider how to allocate resources such as road crews, sewer repair crews, power, and
            rescue teams. Limit your response to 1000 words and 12 images.
        </div>

        <br>
        To determine the problems that are occurring across the St. Himark, we first built the taxonomy for
        1) Types of event related to the earthquake and 2) Types of resources that needed for the situation. The
        taxonomy:
        <br>
        1. Event, including:<br>
        1.1. Earthquake: seismic, earthquake, quake, quaking, shake, shaking, wobble, wobbling, quiver, epicenter<br>
        1.2. Grounds (ground damage): mudslide, rupture, landslides, liquefaction<br>
        1.3. Flooding: tsunami, flood<br>
        1.4. Aftershock: aftershock<br>
        1.5. Fire: fire, smoke<br>
        2. Resources, including:<br>
        2.1. Water: sewage, water, discharge, drain, irrigation, sewer, reservoir<br>
        2.2. Energy: blackout, electric, candle, energy, flashlight, fuel, gas, generator, nuclear, power, radiant,
        radiation, radio rays, valve<br>
        2.3. Medical: ambulance, blood, bruise, dehydrate, emergency, escape, evacuate, evacuating, evacuation, fatal,
        first aid, fracture, hurt, illness, infection, injure, kill, lump, medic, red cross, rescue, rescuing,
        respiratory, suffering, swollen, urgent, victim, wound<br>
        2.4. Shelter: shelter, housing, building, collapse, construction, house<br>
        2.5. Transportation: bridge, traffic, congestion, avalanche, highway, lane, logistic, jammed, route, street,
        transportation<br>
        2.6 Food: food<br>
        <br>
        Besides, we have other options for broader view:<br>
        - All – total classified messages with all categories.<br>
        - Other:<br>
        + Rumble – the app for people to report about the disaster<br>
        + Other posts: posts that don’t have any of these above-mentioned keywords.<br>

        <br>
        We built the taxonomy with an assumption that one message can belong to more than one category, e.g., a message
        can indicate that there are needs for both water and food.
        The reasoning for this assumption comes from the possibility that priorities for resources may change over time,
        hence we need to take all information into account. The sliding window is flexible within the control board,
        window width size can be adjusted to capture a
        particular timeframe.

        From the main control board in <a href="#threeStrikesFig">Figure 2</a>, selection of “Earthquake” show clearly
        three times
        that the
        earthquake
        strikes.
        We used the these peak to specify the timestamp earthquake strikes.
        To consolidate this point, we explore the detail from corresponding messages. The WordStream supports
        highlighting the keywords in the corresponding categories. For example. From 2PM to 3PM, there are 36
        messages about earthquake.
        Especially, at 2:33PM on April 6, at Safe Town, they just recorded an earthquake. Besides, while mousing over
        terms, WordStream highlights the co-occurrences words alongside keywords from the actual messages. Location
        of these messages are
        also emphasized in the “Location” stream and in the geolocation map.

        <br><br>
        The first time earthquake strike is around 2:31:30PM, April 06, 2020.<br>
        The second time earthquake strike is around 8:34:18 AM, April 08, 2020.<br>
        The third time earthquake strike is around 3:03:20 PM, April 09, 2020.<br>

        Related events that may occur during and after earthquake are included to characterize the condition as a whole.
        Besides earthquake, the city also suffered from related event, including: Flood, Tsunami, Aftershock.
        Especially, a fire happen at a broad area.

        <div class="question">2 - Identify at least 3 times when conditions change in a way that warrants a
            re-allocation of
            city
            resources. What were the conditions before and after the inflection point? What locations were affected?
            Which resources are involved? Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.
        </div>


        <div class="question">3 - Take the pulse of the community. How has the earthquake affected life in St. Himark?
            What is the community experiencing outside the realm of the first two questions? Show decision makers
            summary information and relevant/characteristic examples. Limit your response to 800 words and 8 images.
        </div>

        <div class="question">4 - The data for this challenge can be analyzed either as a
            static collection or as a dynamic stream of data, as it would occur in a real emergency. Describe how you
            analyzed the data - as a static collection or a stream. How do you think this choice affected your analysis?
            Limit your response to 200 words and 3 images.
        </div>

        <br>
        For this application, we analyze data as a stream. All the computation, visualization and analytics are done
        dynamically. The system updates every time there are any changes in the main control board - panel A in <a
            href="#overviewFig">Figure 1</a>, the changes can come from expanding the window size, moving the sliding
        window along the horizontal axis, or changing the categories.

        <br>
        In computation: The process of cleaning data, applying the taxonomy to classify messages and scaling are done
        with every
        update of data. In visualization: All 5 panels for visualization update on every move of data.
        Although there are a lot to handle and process, the computational time and rendering time is marginal.
